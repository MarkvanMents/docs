* [How to Deploy Your First Mendix Native Mobile App with the Native Builder CLI](deploying-native-app-cli) – Go from a blank slate to an app running on a device.
* [How to Create a Custom Developer App with the Native Builder CLI](how-to-devapps-cli) – Create a custom developer app: a substitute for the Make It Native app which accommodates custom dependencies such as native widgets or fonts.
