## 1 Introduction

The Marketplace is driven by contributions from members of the Mendix community who share the connectors, modules, and apps they have built. This how-to shows how to add and update Marketplace content.

**This how-to will teach you how to do the following:**

* Add new content and promotions to share in the Marketplace
* Update existing Marketplace content

## 2 Prerequisites

Before starting this how-to, make sure you have completed the following prerequisites:

* Familiarize yourself with the [Marketplace Overview](app-store-overview) and [How to Use Marketplace Content in Studio Pro](app-store-content)

## 3 Marketplace Content Development Guidelines {#submission}

This section presents guidelines for developing content that you will submit to the Mendix Marketplace.

{{% alert type="info" %}}
Submitted Marketplace content will be reviewed within five working days.

### 3.1 General Guidelines

These are some general guidelines for creating new Marketplace content :

* Set up a separate project to build and maintain your Marketplace component
* Use a relatively recent Mendix version when creating the item, not only the latest Mendix version
* Create multiple versions of your Marketplace component (for example, for Studio Pro 8 and Desktop Modeler 7)

You can add information the end-user should know about your content to  can be added for the [Documentation](#doc) when you are adding the content to the Marketplace.

### 3.2 Widget Guidelines

To develop widgets and submit them to Marketplace, follow these guidelines:

* The widget must be based on the [AppStoreBoilerplate](https://github.com/mendix/AppStoreWidgetBoilerplate)
* When writing variable and function names, use lowerCamelCase (for example, *mySecondVariable*)
* Add code comments
* Use descriptive variable and function names in both XML and JavaScript
* Always add `"use strict";` to functions
* A function may not be larger than 200 lines of code
* A function may only do one thing, and it should do it properly
* Internal variables should start with an underscore (`_`)
* Using the Dojo Toolkit and its functionalities is preferred, but for external plugins you can use jQuery
* Create a test project based on the [AppStoreBoilerplate](https://github.com/mendix/AppStoreWidgetBoilerplate)
* Create test pages for mobile when content is mobile-supported

### 3.3 Module Guidelines

To develop modules and submit them to the Marketplace, follow these guidelines:

* Create a folder named **USE_ME** and add the microflows and pages that are relevant for the user
* Create an empty folder with the version number as its name, which will appear in Studio Pro's Project Explorer
* If you add any userlib *jar* files, make sure they are accompanied by a *MyModule.RequiredLib* file so that users know where the *jar* files come from
* Verify that the module's Java actions compile correctly (the easiest way to check is to create a deployment package, as it will clean the deployment folder and rebuild the app; for more information, see [Create Deployment Package Dialog](/developerportal/deploy/environments) and [Environments](/developerportal/deploy/environments))
* Reduce the use of layouts – using snippets will result in fewer module dependencies and will reduce the number of potential errors (for example, missing layouts)
* User roles and security should be implemented 
* Creating a new release or module export should be done while the security level of the project containing the module is set to **Production**
* The module security status (in the **Project Security**) must be **complete** for the following:
	* Page access
	* Microflow access
	* OData access
	* Entity access
	* Dataset access
* For example pages and microflows to be copied to another module, they should be "excluded from project" in order to encourage duplication and reduce dependency errors 
* Do not rename entities and attributes when creating new versions, as data in these entities will get lost (replacing an existing module is based on the entity names)
* The module should include the English language

## 4 Adding New Marketplace Content {#adding}

To add content to the Marketplace, follow these steps:

1.  Click **Add content** in the top-right corner of the Marketplace home screen:

	![](attachments/share-app-store-content/add-content-button.jpg)

2.  Select the type of content you would like to publish. The available types correspond to the content catalogs available on the [Marketplace home page](app-store-overview#home).
3.  Depending on the category you selected, you may be asked to select a sub-category for your component, for example:

	![](attachments/share-app-store-content/sub-categories.jpg)
	
4.  Select the location where you want to publish your component:

	* <a name="public-app-store"></a>**Public Marketplace (all Mendix users)** – your component will be available to the Mendix community (this content will have to be reviewed and approved by Mendix before it is available)
	* <a name="private-app-store"></a>**Private Marketplace (your company only)** – your content will receive the **Company only** label and be available only via your [Company's App Store](app-store-overview#company-content); selected private content of a user group can also be made available to [user group guests](app-store-overview#guests) for download; this content will not be reviewed by Mendix
	
	![](attachments/share-app-store-content/public-private.jpg)
	
	{{% alert type="warning" %}}You can only set this in the initial version of your content. You cannot change this setting by updating the Marketplace component later.
	{{% /alert %}}

5.  The **General** page will open, where you need to provide information about your component. The information you entered above is pre-filled on this page. Enter the following details:<br />
	a. Enter a **Name** for your content.<br />
	b. Enter a **Description** of your content (for example, "Node control is an native Android app that gives a system administrator access to the Mendix Cloud nodes being administered.

## 5 Updating Existing Marketplace Content {#updating}

To update content that has already been published, follow these steps:

1.  Find the component in the correct location by clicking **My Marketplace**and selecting one of the following:
	* **My Content**
	* **Company Content**
	* **User Groups** (note that if an existing Marketplace component is assigned to a [user group](app-store-overview#user-groups) as specific user group [content](app-store-overview#content), you can only update the component if you are a member of that group)
	
2.  Click **Manage** next to the component you want to update.

	{{% alert type="info" %}}Only one draft version of a component can exist at a time, so when one draft version is in progress, another draft cannot be started. If there is a draft version in progress, click **View draft** on the page where you manage the component in order to see the draft.
	{{% /alert %}}

3. You can edit all component details, as described in the [Adding New Marketplace Content](#adding) section above.
4.  In the **Version** section of the **Package** page, update the **Major**, **Minor**, and **Patch** numbers so that the component is saved as a new version:

	* **Major update** – a large change (which will save the content from version 5.0 to version 6.0, for example)
	* **Minor update** – a medium-sized change (which will save the content from version 6.0.0 to version 6.1.0, for example)
	* **Patch** – a small change (which will save the content from 6.1.0 to 6.1.1, for example)

5.  On the **Publish** page, you can review all the details of your component you entered so far and edit as necessary (via the **Edit Section** button) before clicking **Publish Content**.
