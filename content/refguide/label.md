# Label

## 1 Introduction

{% hint style="warning" %}}The label widget is not supported on native mobile pages.{{% /alert %}

{{% alert type="warning" %}}

For input widgets, it is recommended to use the [label property](text-box) to describe the purpose of widgets to end-users.

You can also use the [text widget](text) as it provides more features, e.g. you can add parameters, and it generates semantically correct HTML.

{% endhint %}

A label shows static text, which describes the purpose of a specific widget to a user.
