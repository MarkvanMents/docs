## 1 Introduction

The **Show home page** activity opens the home page for an end-user. For example, you can navigate your user to the home page when they are not logged in. 


![Show Home Page](attachments/client-activities/show-home-page.png)


This activity shows the same page that is displayed to the end-user after they log in, meaning it shows the home page defined for the current user role. For more information on role-based home pages, see [Navigation](navigation).
