# Studio Deployment Settings

## 1 Introduction

If you have a licensed app, you need to select an environment for Mendix Studio separately. For more information on licensed apps and environments, see [Mendix Cloud](mendix-cloud-deploy) and [Environments](environments). 

{% hint style="info" %}

By default the environment is not selected for Studio. Thus, when you try to publish, you will get a warning message. For more information, see [Previewing & Publishing Your App](/studio/publishing-app) in the *Studio Guide*.

{% endhint %}
